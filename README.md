# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project explores customer preferences, spending patterns, restaurant types, and order behaviors using the Zomato dataset. The goal is to uncover business insights that can support data-driven decisions in marketing, pricing, and operations.


**Project Overview**

Analyzed customer behavior across restaurant types, order modes (online/offline), and spending patterns.
Performed data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key business questions such as:
Which restaurant types are most popular?

What are the average ratings received?

How do couples spend per order?

Which mode (online/offline) gets higher ratings?

Which restaurants should be targeted for offline offers?


**ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries**

Python
Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Visualizations
Jupyter Notebook


**ðŸš€ Key Insights**

Majority of customers prefer specific restaurant types.
Online mode dominates in ratings and order frequency.
Couples spend significantly more per order compared to other groups.
Certain restaurant categories are stronger candidates for offline promotional offers.


**ðŸ“Œ Outcome**

This project demonstrates how EDA and visualization can reveal actionable insights from raw customer data. It simulates real-world analytics scenarios where businesses optimize decisions using data-driven strategies.
